                        answer: `
                            <p><strong>Dynamic Memory Allocation</strong> is the process of allocating memory at runtime from the heap. This is useful when the exact memory requirement is not known at compile time. These functions are defined in <code>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code>.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong><code>malloc()</code>:</strong> Allocates a single block of memory of a specified size. It returns a void pointer to the first byte of the allocated space. The memory is not initialized.
                                <br><em>Syntax:</em> <code>ptr = (cast_type*) malloc(byte_size);</code></li>
                                
                                <li><strong><code>calloc()</code>:</strong> Allocates memory for an array of elements, initializes all bytes to zero, and returns a pointer to the first element.
                                <br><em>Syntax:</em> <code>ptr = (cast_type*) calloc(n, element_size);</code></li>

                                <li><strong><code>realloc()</code>:</strong> Changes the size of a previously allocated memory block. It can expand or shrink the memory.
                                <br><em>Syntax:</em> <code>ptr = realloc(old_ptr, new_size);</code></li>

                                <li><strong><code>free()</code>:</strong> Deallocates (releases) a block of memory that was previously allocated by <code>malloc</code>, <code>calloc</code>, or <code>realloc</code>, making it available for future use.
                                <br><em>Syntax:</em> <code>free(ptr);</code></li>

                            <p>The <code>fopen()</code> function uses a mode string to determine how a file should be opened. The primary modes are:</p>

                                <li><strong><code>"a"</code> (Append):</strong> Opens a text file for writing in append mode. The output is added to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>"r+"</code> (Read/Update):</strong> Opens a text file for both reading and writing. The file must exist.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>"w+"</code> (Write/Update):</strong> Opens a text file for both reading and writing. If the file exists, its contents are erased. If it does not exist, a new file is created.</li>
                                <li><strong><code>"a+"</code> (Append/Update):</strong> Opens a text file for both reading and appending. Reading starts from the beginning, but writing (appending) is always at the end.</li>

                            <p><strong>Principle:</strong> The determination of hardness by the EDTA method is a complexometric titration. EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a strong complexing agent that forms stable, colorless complexes with Ca¬≤‚Å∫ and Mg¬≤‚Å∫ ions.</p>

When EDTA is titrated against the water sample, it sequentially displaces the EBT from the metal-EBT complex. At the endpoint, all metal ions are complexed with EDTA, and the EBT indicator becomes free, changing the color of the solution from wine-red to its original steel-blue.</p>

                            <p><strong>Reverse Osmosis (RO)</strong> is a water purification process that uses a semi-permeable membrane to remove ions, molecules, and larger particles from drinking water.</p>
                            <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Osmosis is the natural tendency of a solvent (like water) to pass through a semi-permeable membrane from a region of low solute concentration to a region of high solute concentration. In Reverse Osmosis, external pressure is applied to the side with the higher concentration (e.g., salt water). If this pressure is greater than the natural osmotic pressure, it forces the solvent (pure water) to move in the reverse direction, from the high concentration side to the low concentration side, leaving the dissolved salts behind.</p>
                            <p><strong>Application:</strong> The primary application of RO is in the <strong>desalination of seawater or brackish water</strong> to produce fresh, potable water. It is also widely used in residential water purifiers.</p>`

                        answer: `
                            <p><strong>Principle:</strong> IR spectroscopy involves the absorption of infrared radiation by a molecule, which causes the bonds within the molecule to vibrate (stretch or bend). For a vibration to be 'IR active' (i.e., for it to absorb IR radiation), it must cause a <strong>change in the net dipole moment</strong> of the molecule.</p>
                            <p><strong>IR Inactivity of N‚ÇÇ and O‚ÇÇ:</strong></p>
                            <p>Molecules like dinitrogen (N‚â°N) and dioxygen (O=O) are homonuclear diatomic molecules. They are perfectly symmetrical and have a net dipole moment of zero. When the bond in these molecules stretches, the symmetry is maintained, and the dipole moment remains zero. Since there is no change in the dipole moment during the vibration, they cannot absorb IR radiation and are therefore considered <strong>IR inactive</strong>.</p>`

                            <p><strong>Glass Transition Temperature (Tg):</strong></p>
                            <p>Tg is a property of <strong>amorphous</strong> or non-crystalline materials (like polymers and glasses). It is the temperature at which the material transitions from a hard, rigid, glassy state to a more flexible, rubbery state.

                            <p>UV-Visible spectroscopy involves the promotion of electrons from a ground state molecular orbital to an excited state. The main types of transitions are:</p>

                                <li><strong>œÄ ‚Üí œÄ* (Pi to Pi Star):</strong> Involves promoting an electron from a pi bonding orbital to a pi anti-bonding orbital. Occurs in compounds with double or triple bonds (e.g., alkenes, alkynes, aromatics). These are typically strong absorptions.</li>
                                <li><strong>n ‚Üí œÄ* (n to Pi Star):</strong> Involves promoting a non-bonding electron to a pi anti-bonding orbital.

                            <p><strong>Vulcanization</strong> is a chemical process for converting natural rubber or related polymers into more durable materials by heating them with sulfur or other equivalent curatives or accelerators.</p>
                            <p><strong>Process:</strong> Natural rubber is a polymer of isoprene. During vulcanization, sulfur atoms form cross-links (bridges) between the long, individual polymer chains of rubber. This creates a more rigid, three-dimensional network structure.</p>
                            <p><strong>Necessity of Vulcanization:</strong></p>
                            <p>Natural rubber has several undesirable properties:</p>

                                <li>It is soft and sticky.</li>
                                <li>It has low tensile strength and poor abrasion resistance.</li>
                                <li>It becomes very soft at high temperatures and brittle at low temperatures.</li>

                            <p>Vulcanization drastically improves these properties by introducing cross-links, making the rubber harder, stronger, more elastic over a wider range of temperatures, and more resistant to chemicals.</p>`

                            <p>Free radical polymerization is a type of addition polymerization that proceeds via a chain mechanism involving free radicals. A common example is the polymerization of vinyl chloride to form PVC. The mechanism involves three main steps:</p>
                            <p><strong>1. Initiation:</strong></p>
                            <p>The process starts with the creation of a free radical from an initiator molecule (like benzoyl peroxide). This initiator radical then adds to a monomer molecule, creating a new, larger monomer radical.</p>
                            <p><strong>2. Propagation:</strong></p>
                            <p>The monomer radical rapidly adds to another monomer molecule, extending the chain. This process repeats thousands of times, creating a long polymer chain with the radical at the growing end.</p>

                                <li><strong>Strength:</strong> As DP increases, the polymer chains become longer, leading to more entanglement and stronger intermolecular forces (van der Waals forces). This results in increased tensile strength, impact resistance, and overall toughness.</li>
                                <li><strong>Viscosity:</strong> The viscosity of the polymer in its molten state or in solution increases significantly with increasing DP, as longer chains are more resistant to flow.</li>
                                <li><strong>Melting/Softening Point:</strong> Longer chains require more energy to overcome intermolecular forces and move freely, so the melting point or glass transition temperature generally increases with DP.</li>
                                <li><strong>State:</strong> At very low DP, polymers are often liquids or oils. As DP increases, they become waxy solids, and at high DP, they become tough, rigid plastics.</li>

                                <li><strong>Stereospecificity:</strong> Their most important feature is the ability to control the tacticity of the polymer. They can produce highly regular structures like isotactic or syndiotactic polymers, which was not possible with free-radical methods. This control allows for the synthesis of polymers with enhanced crystallinity and superior mechanical properties.</li>
                                <li><strong>Polymerization of Alkenes:</strong> They enabled the polymerization of simple alkenes like ethene and propene at low temperatures and pressures, which was previously very difficult.

                        answer: `
                            <p><strong>Elastomers</strong> are polymers that possess high elasticity. They can be stretched to many times their original length and will return to their original shape and size when the stretching force is removed.</p>
                            <p><strong>Structural Feature for Elasticity:</strong></p>
                            <p>The unique elastic property of elastomers is due to their specific molecular structure:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Amorphous Structure with Coiled Chains:</strong> In the unstretched state, the polymer chains are long, flexible, and exist in a highly coiled and entangled, amorphous arrangement. This represents a state of high entropy (high disorder).</li>
                                <li><strong>Few Cross-links:</strong> The chains are held together by a few weak cross-links. These cross-links are crucial. When the material is stretched, the coiled chains uncoil and align in the direction of the force.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reversible Deformation:</strong> The cross-links prevent the chains from permanently slipping past one another. When the stretching force is removed, the chains do not remain aligned; instead, they spontaneously return to their original, more stable, coiled (high entropy) state. This ability to return to the original shape is the essence of elasticity.</li>
                            </ol>

                        answer: `
                            <p><strong>Preparation:</strong></p>
                            <p>Nylon 6,6 is a polyamide prepared by the <strong>condensation polymerization</strong> of two monomers: <strong>hexamethylenediamine</strong> (which has 6 carbon atoms and two amino groups) and <strong>adipic acid</strong> (which has 6 carbon atoms and two carboxylic acid groups). The name '6,6' comes from the fact that both monomers contain 6 carbon atoms.</p>
                            <p>During polymerization, the amino group of hexamethylenediamine reacts with the carboxylic acid group of adipic acid, forming an amide linkage (-CO-NH-) and eliminating a molecule of water (H‚ÇÇO) as a by-product.</p>

                                <li><strong>High Mechanical Strength and Toughness:</strong> Due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the amide groups of adjacent chains, Nylon 6,6 is very strong and resistant to abrasion.</li>
                                <li><strong>High Melting Point and Thermal Stability:</strong> The strong hydrogen bonding also gives it a high melting point (around 265¬∞C), making it suitable for applications requiring heat resistance.</li>

                            <p><strong>Glass Transition Temperature (Tg):</strong></p>
                            <p>Tg is a property of the <strong>amorphous</strong> (non-crystalline) regions of a polymer. It is the temperature at which the polymer transitions from a hard, rigid, glassy state to a soft, flexible, rubbery state. Below Tg, the polymer chains are frozen and have limited mobility. Above Tg, the chains have enough thermal energy to move past each other, making the material flexible.</p>
                            <p><strong>Melting Temperature (Tm):</strong></p>
                            <p>Tm is a property of the <strong>crystalline</strong> regions of a polymer. It is the temperature at which the ordered, crystalline structures within the polymer break down and the material melts to become a viscous liquid. This is a true first-order phase transition involving a latent heat of fusion.</p>
                            <p><strong>Key Differences:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Applicability:</strong> Tg applies to amorphous regions, while Tm applies to crystalline regions. A completely amorphous polymer will only have a Tg, while a semi-crystalline polymer will exhibit both a Tg and a Tm.</li>
                                <li><strong>Nature of Transition:</strong> Tg is a second-order transition related to chain mobility and is seen as a change in properties like stiffness and thermal expansion. Tm is a first-order phase transition where the material changes state from solid to liquid.</li>

                            <p>A <strong>'flat discharge curve'</strong> refers to the voltage profile of a battery during discharge. A battery with a flat curve maintains a nearly constant, stable voltage throughout most of its discharge cycle, only dropping sharply when it is nearly empty.</p>

                                <li><strong>Predictable Performance:</strong> Electronic devices are designed to operate at a specific voltage. A stable voltage supply from the battery ensures the device performs consistently and reliably.</li>
                                <li><strong>Efficient Power Delivery:</strong> A constant voltage allows for more efficient power regulation and conversion within the device.</li>
                                <li><strong>Inaccurate State-of-Charge Indication:</strong> A downside is that it can be difficult to determine the remaining charge just by measuring the voltage, as the voltage stays high until the very end of the cycle. More complex methods are needed for accurate battery level indicators.</li>

                        answer: `
                            <p>The <strong>Fingerprint Region</strong> in an IR spectrum is the complex area typically between <strong>1500 cm‚Åª¬π and 400 cm‚Åª¬π</strong>.</p>
                            <p><strong>Importance:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>This region results from complex vibrational and rotational coupling, making it highly unique for every molecule.</li>
                                <li>While the functional group region (above 1500 cm‚Åª¬π) helps identify specific functional groups (like C=O or O-H), the fingerprint region is used to confirm the exact identity of a compound.</li>
                                <li>By comparing the fingerprint region of an unknown sample to that of a known standard, a definitive identification can be made, much like matching a human fingerprint.</li>
                            </ul>`
